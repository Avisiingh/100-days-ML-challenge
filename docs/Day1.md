##  Python Basics â€“ Data, Variables, Strings, and Numbers  

### ðŸ“Œ What I Learned  
- Understanding **data types** in Python (integers, floats, strings, booleans).  
- How to create and use **variables**.  
- Basic **string operations** like concatenation and string methods.  
- Working with **numbers** and performing arithmetic operations.  
- **String slicing** to extract parts of a string.  
- **Reversing strings** using slicing (`[::-1]`).  

### ðŸš§ Challenges  
- Initially struggled with **string slicing and reversing words**, but with the help of **ChatGPT**, I was able to build the logic and understand it better.
